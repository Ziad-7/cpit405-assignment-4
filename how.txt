first you need to generate the html page using DOM API(liElem, ulElem, etc...)

sort images based on up to 3 properties
give each image meta data using array
this is how to create the array:
var images =[
                    {
                    name: "Cute cat",
                    likes: 20,
                    dateUploaded: "23/18/2018",
                    src: "images/cute-cat.png"
                    },

                    {
                    name: "big cat",
                    likes: 15,
                    dateUploaded: "15/18/2018",
                    src: "images/big-cat.png"
                    }

                    ]
Objects
Mouse Events

you need to handle mouse events: if user selects sort crieteria 
sort done by: sorting the array "images"
then
generate html elements using the new sorted array

tips: use 2 functions
1 for sorting array by property
2 for generating html elements
